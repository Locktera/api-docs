# Encode Example

The `encode` example shows how to use the Locktera API with Node.js to encode a Locktera container.

## Customization

The script will take the DRM rules from `input/manifest.json` and each other content file from the `input` folder and create a new container in your Locktera library.

You can customize `input/manifest.json` to change the DRM rules or make them static, and you can add or remove files from the `input` directory to try out different types of content.
